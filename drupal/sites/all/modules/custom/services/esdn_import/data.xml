She had difficulty in walking and weakness of the lower limbs, put her weight on the right side. Urine screening was done to rule out MPS and the result was negative. The disease has been progressive for the last one year. At 10 years, elbow joints were swollen and enlarged but no pain. She underwent surgery at 10 years for ulnar nerve release because of ? clawing and wasting of palms. At 10  years she developed knock knees and chest deformity at 11 years. She had difficulty in moving her neck, complained of breathlessness after a fast walk. On examination – Her height –132 cms. Upper segment / lower segment – 60cms / 73 cms, weight 29 Kg. Arm span 144.5 cms. Chest 74 cms Head Circumference 51.5 cms. Upper limbs – cubitus varus, both elbows appear enlarged but not tender, wrist joints and shoulder appear normal. Hands – IP joints are enlarged and deformed but not tender, palms appear wasted, fingers are spindle shaped. Swan neck deformity in little finger Lower Limbs – Genu valgum, hallux valgus, knee joint appear enlarged, ankles normal but toe joints appear enlarged and deformed.

Appearance of Peau d€™orange He was born at 35 weeks gestation following a pregnancy in which an abnormal nuchal fold measurement had been observed. The only other unusual findings had been enlarged kidney and a 2 vessel cord in the foetus. The mother noticed decreased foetal movements from around 26 weeks€™ gestation. Amniocentesis chromosomes were normal. His mother complained of an itchy skin rash during the pregnancy. Caden was born at 35 weeks gestation and required intermittent CPAP from birth. He was a few weeks old when he became more unwell and it was at this stage that the neonatal doctors first tried to intubate him. They were unable to because of his subglottic stenosis and he was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital. He has twice required a cricoid split. In addition the right congenital diaphragmatic hernia was diagnosed and repaired. He remained oxygen-dependent for several months. He had a large anterior fontanelle. Growth €“ His birth weight was on the 9th centile. All parameters have remained below, but parallel to the 0.4th centile consistently. Renal: Renal biopsy was consistent with developmental renal dysplasia. His renal function has improved but he remains under follow-up with the nephrologist and on prophylactic antibiotics. Cardiac and respiratory: The first echo in the neonatal period showed normal anatomy, but subsequent echo€™s have shown mild biventricular hypertrophy, small ASD and mildly elevated right ventricular pressure, which subsequently resolved. More recently he has had episodes of desaturations and cyanosis. Cardiac review was normal. He had been referred to a respiratory physician and will have an overnight sleep study in a few weeks time to monitor his oxygen saturations. Liver Disease:He had abnormal liver function from birth with AST around 300 and he subsequently developed a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. His liver function has gradually improved and he is no longer on treatment. Skin Lesions: all his unusual skin lesions are down the right side of his body, with the exception of a small capillary haemangioma on his left fingertips. The skin lesions have the appearance of peau d€™orange. I understand that skin biopsies of these lesions were taken by the dermatologist at GOSH. His parents told me they have been given a histological diagnosis of eccrine naevus. These skin lesions have changed over time and are now much flatter, but remain erythematous. At around 15 months of age a mobile irregularly shaped mass developed on his right foot. It felt hard, possibly cartilaginous or calcified. He had some erythematous areas over the surface. He has two small chickenpox-like scars on his face, but has not had chicken pox. He has an absent patch of hair on the back of his head. Ophthalmology:I understand he has chorioretinal atrophy and he also has a right ptosis. As far as I am aware he did not have cataracts. Neurodevelopment: Serial cranial ultrasounds in the newborn period showed a prominent septum pellucidum, but otherwise normal appearances. Brain CT was reported as normal. At three years of age, his development has been assesssed by c paediatricain as being age appropriate. At his last genetics review in April 2009, new findings were that his teeth appear thin and widely spaced. He did not have any teeth before 19 months of age. He has dry skin and the early findings of peau d€™orange are still apparent. He has an indentation on the sole of his right foot and the area on the dorsal surface of this foot, which appeared to be subcutaneous calcification, has not grown since I last saw him and is now much less apparent. He does have the appearance of a short neck with a scoliosis. His arms actually now appear long in comparison to his trunk and I was unclear on examination if this would be due to his scoliosis or due to truncal shortening. He had quite a prominent lumbar lordosis and a leg length discrepancy as previously described. He has quite a broad nasal bridge with a bulbous nose and round ears with pointy and wide spaced teeth.

Detailed fetal anomaly scan at 21 weeks gestation showed hydrops, very short long bones, polydactyly of left hand, narrow and long chest with short ribs and bilateral hydrothorax, lemon-shaped head with absent cerebellar vermis, dilated cisterna magna, enlarged 4th ventricle and normal 3rd ventricle, and moderate ascites. Pregnancy terminated at 21 weeks gestation. Cordocentesis prior to termination showed normal male fetal karyotype. Fetal post-mortem examination showed mildly macerated male fetus with measurements consistent with 20-21 weeks gestation, large head, hypertelorism, posterior central cleft palate, short limbs, no polydactyly or syndactyly of hands or feet, small chest with hypoplastic lungs, and macerated brain with small cerebellum. Bone histology (rib, vertebra, femur) showed narrow growth zone with no chondrocyte columns and abnormal endochondral ossification. Bone formation away from growth zone appeared normal. Fetal x-ray findings thought to be consistent with a variant form of thanatophoric dysplasia. Post-mortem fetal MRI scan showed 2 cerebral hemispheres, no definite corpus callosum, small cerebellum with left cerebellar hemisphere smaller than right and incomplete cerebellar vermis. However, poor quality images. Both parents of normal stature. No relevant family history.</summary>

		<summary>Based on radiological and neuropathological information 1st pregnancy for this couple, mother is 42 and father is 45. Unremarkable pregnancy until 20/40 scan revealed short limbs and abnormal skull shape. Described as clover-leaf by obstetrician. In addition, severe ventriculomegaly was detected. Pregnancy was interrupted at 20 weeks +1. PM showed male fetus with abnormal skull shape (although not quite clover-leaf), short limbs, slightly narrow thorax. Physical findings suggestive of skeletal dysplasia but not typical of thanatophoric dysplasia. Neuropathology showed: - macrencephaly (fixed intact brain 95g normal range 55.4+/-10g) - abnormal configuration of the temporal lobes, symmetrically enlarged with abnormal sulcation - dysplastic hippocampi - aqueduct dilated - callosal hypoplasia/partial agenesis Baby X-ray revealed: - shortened femur, humerus, not particularly bowed. - thorax slightly narrowed No family history of significance. Advanced maternal and advanced paternal ages. Neuropathological findings appear to be in-keeping with thanatophoric dyslasia bearing in mind the clinical features and radiographic evidence, we feel that a possible diagnosis here is thanatophoric dysplasia type II. Parents are both of advanced ages and are keen to have another pregnancy. They are due to see us in clinic on 18th May 2007. We would be grateful for your thoughts and grateful if you would consider if TD is the possible diagnosis here and consider mutation testing for FGFR3 or a more appropriate condition as you see fit. Many thanks.</summary>

		<summary>At h. 15+6 short limbs and a narrow thorax were seen in the ultrasound examination of this pregnancy. The lengths of the limbs were as follows: femur h. 14+2, tibia 13+6, humerus 13+5, radius 12+6, ulna 13+1. The family decided to terminate the pregnancy. The autopsy revealed short limbs and a narrow thorax. The femur was short and bending. The tibia was almost angulated. The cranium and the horns of the iliac bones were ossified. The upper limbs were more normal than the lower limbs, even though the humerus was shorter and thicker than usually. The microscopic analysis of the bone: The cartilage in the long bone was very scanty. The cartilage was organized in columns of large cells. The endochondral ossification seemed to be within normal limits. The columns of osteocytes were dys-morphic. The layer of cortical bone was thin. The bone marrow was fibrotic and there was only a little hematopoiesis. There was calcification and ossification of cartilage in the ribs. There was mesenchy-mal cartilage with eosinophilic cytoplasm in the sternum. The karyotype of the fetus was normal 46, XY This was the first pregnancy of a healthy 30 year old female. Her husband is also a healthy person. There is no history of congenital or skeletal disorders in the family.</summary>

		<summary>Radiography, Measurement, Ultrasound 12 week scan on 24th June 2003 was normal. 20 week scan showed: The thorax is appreciably narrower than the abdomen. Humerus bones were 19.8 and 19mm in length and radial measurement was 14mm each. Ulna = 14mm each side. Tiba measured 16.6mm and fibula was 15.2mm on each side. The long bones were short and bowed. The measurements of the bones were well below the expected measurements for 19 week gestation. Short and bowed limb bones with narrow thorax would be suggestive of short limb skeletal dysplasia. Mother (from Poland) is a 29 year old primigravid. Father (Lebanese) No significant family history of abnormalities Gender was not specified. The pregnancy was interrupted, and the fetus was born breech 12 hours later. The clinician may have inflicted some trauma to the left foot during delivery. This case was originally coded ESDN MAN-03-050. The referring clinician, Dr John Vaughan, is based in Awali Hospital, Awali, Bahrain, Arabian Gulf and is aware a charge for any molecular tests will be made. The lab in Manchester was sent some samples from the fetus. Clinical photographs are available but as yet have not been posted on this website.

During the 20th gestational week of the pregnancy it was noticed by ultra sound that femurs were short and curved and also length of both humeri seemed to be in the lower limit of normal range (the parents were not willing to terminate the pregnancy). She was born normally but all four limbs were very short (lower limbs more severely affected than upper) and one fracture was noticed immediately after the birth. The facial features are dysmorphic and sclerae are bluish. No hereditary diseases in the family, no OI known in the pedigree.</summary>

She suffered from recurrent patella dislocation. From early adulthood, she has had chronic hip and back pain and also has some restriction in movement of her shoulder joint. Her adult height is 1.6m. The most obvious skeletal abnormality is her proximal limb shortening, brachydactyly and her broad, hyper extensible thumbs. Son: (date of birth: 11/01/1999) the only abnormality is that he walks with a slightly lordotic gait. His head circumference is on the 75th to 90th centile at 52.5cm and his height is currently 104cm. Yes see attached pedigree drawing. At least 4 generations have been affected. All affected relatives have had a similar pattern of problems. This case is from Dr Helen Cox (Southampton UK). The DNA for the mother was sent to the lab at St. Mary’s, Manchester. (NGRL#034405).

His complaint has been continued for two years. His weight, length and head circumference were 21 kg (50-75 p), 102 cm (50-75 p) and 51 cm respectively. On physical examination, genu valgum was noted. Other physical examination findings were normal. He had a normal mental-motor development. The laboratory investigations including complete blood count, routine biochemical testing of liver and kidney function, thyroid function tests were all in normal limits. X-ray of the hip showed agenesis of right capital femoral epiphysis, and delayed ossification of the left capital femoral epiphysis. Skeletal survey was normal. The patient was the first child of the non-consanguineous parents. Family history was unsignificant. Tyroid function tests and skeletal survey other than X-ray of the hip,were normal.</summary>

Patient has normal intelligence, his height is 1.73m. No evident other complaints. no other family members affected. Parents alive and healthy. Height of father 1.78m, of mother 1.73 and of sister 1.73m. on review of the X-rays in 2004, the Dutch skeletal dysplasia workgroup concluded an autosomal dominant form of MED is most probable, although a definite diagnosis could not be made.

		<summary>radiographs, history Bria Qaradaghy is an 11 year old boy who presents with his parents and younger brother for evaluation for a skeletal dysplasia. A problem was first noticed when Bria was 9 years old and he had less than expected growth for age. He had testing done at this time which revealed normal ESR, free T4, TSH, Rheumatoid factor, ANA, and IGF-1. X-rays showed a delayed bone age with chronologic age 9y4m, and bone age 7y, and more extensive subsequent x-rays revealed epiphyseal abnormalities. He also was evaluated by three orthopedic surgeons (One was Dr. Wimberly from CNMC, and another was Dr. Jeff Hanway) for genu valgum (knock knee deformity), and surgery was suggested to the parents, but not pursued as his parents were concerned about a wider skeletal problem. Bria describes knee stiffness after heavy exercise and then resting, but denies any joint pain, or stiffness in any other of his joints during the activity. He has no history of fractures or broken bones. Bria was evaluated at INOVA medical center genetics by Dr. Lawanda who felt that he had multiple epiphyseal dysplasia vs. spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and recommended evaluation here. Bria's growth chart from his pediatrician's office shows that he has been growing along the 10-25 precentile for height and along the 50th percentile for weight. Weight 36.7 kg (50th percentile), height 135 cm (5th percentile), HC 53.5 cm (50th percentile). Gen app: Awake alert, interactive, in no acute distress. HEENT: head normocephalic, atraumatic, mild plagiocepahly, EOMI, PERRL, nares patent, mucous membranes moist, normal palate and uvula, teeth appear normal, ears and eyes normally set, mildly synophorous. CV: S1S2 rrr, no murmur rub or gallop. Chest: mild pectus excavatum. Resp: clear to auscultation. Abd: +bowel sounds, soft, non tender, non distended, no organomegaly. Back: no scoliosis. Ext: Warm, dry and well perfused. Digits and palmar creases are normal. Right hand: 15.5 cm, left hand: 16.0 cm, right middle finger 7 cm, left middle finger 7 cm, all within normal limits. Moderate genu valgum at knees. Rigth foot 23 cm (within normal limits). + wrist sign bilaterally, can grasp hands behind back. Beighton score 3/9 (fingers, palms on floor when bending at waist). Neuro: CN 2-11 grossly intact, moving all extremities equally reflexes 2+/4 at ankles, knees and triceps. Radiographs from outside institution demonstrate: Hip and knee joints with reduced ossification at epiphyses; epiphyses at proximal and distal femur, proximal and distal tibiae are small and irregular, but present. Overall no osteopenia noted. Proximal normal appearing phalanges. Somewhat flattened vertebrae and some rounding of the superior and inferior anterior border of the lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae. Family History: Please see chart in genetics office for full three generation pedigree. Briefly, Bria's mother is 35 years old and healthy, and his father is 39 years old and healthy. He has one 5 year old brother who is healthy. His mother has 3 living sisters and 4 living brothers who are all healthy. She had one sister who died of an illness at 3 years of age. Bria has 1 male cousin on is mothers side who has ashort leg, all of his other cousins on his mothers side are healthy. His father has 2 sisters and 2 brothers who are healthy, and they all have healthy children. His parents are first cousins (his mother's father is the brother of his father's mother). His parents are both of Northern Iraqi heritage.There is no other family history of skeletal/bone problems, short stature, multiple miscarriages or learning disabilities. He walked at 11 months of age. Past medical history: Hospitalized one time as a young child for dehydration and diarrhea. No other history of hospitalizations or surgeries. Birth History: Born full term via vaginal delivery to a 24 year old mother and 28 year old father. There were no pregnancy complications or drug/medication exposures. His birthweight was 7 pounds. He breastfed until 3 months of age and then switched to bottle feeding. There was no feedlig intolerance such as reflux or vomiting. Developmental history: Described as normal by his parents. He walked at 11 months of age. He is in the sixth grade. His grades are all A's and B's and he has no special educational needs. Dietary history: Allergic to seafood. Has no other food intolerance/allergies, however he does not like to eat fruit. Attending Addendum: I performed a history and physical exam of the patient and discussed the management with Dr. Vernon and Mr. and Mrs. Qaradaghy. I reviewed the above note, made edits and agree with the documented findings and plan of care. In the skeletal survey obtained today, there are no double layered patellae and flexion/extension films of the neck are normal. The proximal humeri also have small, irregular epiphyses. The ilia taper inferiorly. The epiphyses of the hands do not appears as abnormal as those of the long bones. The spine does not appear to have the discrete superior and inferior 'step off' or 'beaking' that would be suggestive of a COMP mutation. Double layered patellae are consistent with DTDST mutations; this radiographic feature is not seen here. We discussed that there are autosomal dominant forms of MED caused by mutations in COL9A1, 9A2, 9A3, COMP and matrillin. Since his parents do not have joint pain or problems and are average stature, it seems most likely that Bria represents a spontaneous mutation in one of these genes or another, as yet undefined, AD gene causing MED. If he has a dominant form of a skeletal dysplasia, he would have a 50% chance of passing this on to each of his offspring. A recessive form of MED is also known and caused by mutations in DTDST but this is less likely based on his relatively mild course and lack of double layered patella. Isolated radiographs of the hands, AP knees and pelvis of Bria's 5 year old brother, Yad, were obtained and show normal epiphyses at all sites. The parents had requested these radiographs to find if Yad was similarly affected. The Qaradaghys have been notified that his films appear normal and he does not appear affected with the same condition that Bria has. However, it is suggested that another set of these same images are collected on Yad in 1-2 years to ensure there is no interval change. We have no radiographs of Bria at that age to compare to that of Yad, but it is unlikely that this is a bone deterioration problem that would have appeared normal at 5 years in Bria (as now in Yad) and now appear as severe at the epiphyses as it is in Bria today at the age of 11 years. Most likely Bria's abnormal epiphyses are due to a developmental problem; they never ossified correctly or completely, NOT that they were normal at one time and deteriorated.</summary>

		<summary>Post mortem radiological review by Professor Christine Hall and post mortem / histopathology by Dr Rosemary Scott Fetus terminated at 22 weeks' gestation. Reports reproduced below: (1) Scan: short long bones, bowed tibiae, hypomineralised vertebrae, small chest, slightly short ribs. (2) Radiology: The thorax is small, with some shortening of the ribs. There is absent ossification of several vertebral bodies, particularly in the cervical region and the sacrum. The acetabular roofs are horizontal. The ong bones are mildly short, and in the lower limbs there is some very mild bowing of both the femora and the tibiae. There is significant shortening of the first metacarpals and the first metatarsals. Many of the features would be consistent with the diagnosis of hypochondrogenesis, which is in the same spectrum of abnormalities as achondrogenesis type II and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita... The short first metacarpals and metatarsals do not really fit with any of these diagnoses, but I am unable to offer an alternative suggestion. (3) Histology: The cartilage at the costochondral junction and ossification centres is disorganised. The chondrocytes are arranged in clusters rather than columns. No obvious inclusions are seen and PAS staining is negative. Bone formation is normal. Nil DNA stored - ?COL2A1 mutation analysis</summary>

		<summary>Xrays Dr. Turnpenny:  I attach X-rays of a fetus with a diagnosis of probable achondrogenesis type 2. The parents are keen for a molecular diagnosis if this can be achieved, and I am waiting for the arrival of tissue blocks. Is this definitely achondrogenesis 2 or should we also be considering achondrogenesis type 1? This would alter the focus of molecular work and it would presumably be easier to look for mutations in DTDST rather than COL2A1.  no info This is all we have...not even gestational age - but is must be very early, say, 14 to 15 weeks (ASF) I have enlarged two views and filtered them out in the attempt at bringing out all details, but the quality was not good in the first place and the fetus is really tiny (ASF) Sorry for the lack of data - Andreas is on holidays...</summary>

At birth his weight was 4220g, and height was 54,5 cm. At 3 weeks a tracheo-esophageal fistula was operated. Later joint contractures were detected: in fingers, hips, and knees. Also, the neck was stiff, and he could not raise his hands above shoulders. Physical therapy was initiated. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a hydronephrosis l. sin (PU-obstruction) without a need for a operation. Heart ultrasound analysis revealed normal structures. He is growing well; the height +1.5 SD, and OFC +1.5 SD. The psychomotoral development is normal. The facial features of the child are dysmorphic as can be seen from the attached pictures. The palate is high and narrow. The teeth were normal. There are contractures is several of the DIP, PIP, and MCP joints, and the left wrist. There is a limited extension in the elbows l.a., and the knees (5-10 degrees). The brother of the father of the index died at 8 years, and had a severe mental retardation without unknown etiology.

		<summary>Picked up at birth MA DOB 10/03/2004 First child of a consanguineous pakistani couple. Pregnancy was normal and the antenatal scans were reported as being unremarkable. MA was born at term and was noted to have short limbs. He had respiratory distress at birth requiring admission to SCBU. MA has had feeding difficulties and a continuing oxygen requirement, though this is being weaned down. He has also had a bilateral hernia repair. A diagnosis of achondroplasia was initially considered and then discounted and a FGFR3 mutation analysis was negative. On examination MA has a large head (98th centile) with normal fontanelles and low set ears. He has both mesomelic and rhizomelic shortening of his limbs with bowing of his lower limbs. There is no brachydactyly, however there is ulnar deviation of his fingers and bilateral adducted thumbs. He has a small chest. MA's skeletal survey was kindly reviewed by Prof Hall who noted there was shortening of all his long bones with bowing and irregularity of metaphyses. There was less shortening of his hands. The iliac wings are square with horizontal acetabula. The vertebral bodies are round with wide intervertebral spaces. She was unable to offer a diagnosis and advised we seek your opinion. His father is on the 3rd centile with a mild degree of limb shortening, which was felt to be rhizomelic in nature. He has a straight spine and did not have a madelung deformity. He has recently had a skeletal survey and we are awaiting the report. Parents are very keen regarding a diagnosis and recurrence risk s wish to have further children.</summary>

		<summary>2nd trimester fetus ultrasound screening was made. Computer tomography was made. Obduction was made by the pathologist. The fetus (index patient 281209) is from the third pregnancy. The nuchal fold thickness of the index fetus was increased to 3,9 mm. The 2nd trimester ultrasound screening was made at gestation week 18 + 6. The signs were following: the head was abnormally broad, lateral ventricles vere large, 3rd ventricle was abnormal, and the cerebellum was invisibable, renal pyelectasis (more than 4 mm) was observed, the extremities were very short, vertebral column was short, skeletal architecture was abnormal (fragile-like). The parents requested the permission for abortion, and it was allowed due to the poor prognosis. The family has two healthy children (son was born 2007 and daughter was born 2008). The fetus from the third pregnancy is identified with the patient index (ID 281209). The fourth pregnancy was after the index patient 281209. The fourth fetus and pregnacy were similar to the fetus and pregnacy of index patient. Abortion was allowed. The radiologic findings from CT were chondral defects and the large proximal ureter (CD from CT will be sent). The obduction signs were the following. The cerebellum was observed as a little athrophic, and ventricle dilatation was observed. There was a head bone defect: large area without bone in the head. The extremities were short and the vertebrae was short. There was a pearl-necklace like structure on the ribs. Histologic findigs from the ribs refer to an unspesific hypophosphatatic bone defect The lungs were small and the lobe formation of the left lung was abnormal. The apex of the heart was duplex. Large renal pyelectasias and ureter dilatations were observed.</summary>

DNA analysis can be done by Anna Villa but can take up to 6 months, she advices to do bone marrow transplantation now regarding, our transplantation docter is tending to advice the same thing.

Previous terminated pregnancy with same ultrasonographic features at 18th week of gestation (short long bones, severe thoracic hypoplasia). The proposed diagnosis was: thanatophoric dysplasia. No x-ray and no molecular analysis were performed. No images are available. Both pregnancies were obtained from Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). In the second case we have carried out fibroblast culture. Samples of umbilical cord, placenta and fetal tissues were also obtained for DNA store.</summary>

		<summary>I would like to present clinical details of 2 fetuses of this couple. The couple is an unrelated healthy Jewish couple. The mother is of Yeman/Ashkenazi origin and the father is of marrocco origin. They have no healthy children. The first fetus was diagnosed on 14 weeks of pregnancy because of severely short long bones, proximal bones of the lower limbs were bowed, broken ribs and narrow chest. There was depressed nasal bone and frontal bossing. We excluded the mutations R248C and Y373C which are the commonest mutations in FGFR3 while the diagnosis is Thanatophoric dysplasia type I. The other disease in the DD was OI but we did not continue the test. On the second pregnancy the same findings were found on 15 weeks. In addition an open metopic suture, undermineralisation of the skull, hypotelorism. The long bones were extrimely short, bowed with fractures in the legs. The ribs were unorganized and might be fractured. The chest was not severely narrowed. Because of the hypomineralization of the skull we thought of Hypophosphatasia. The fetuses did not receive the same haplotype in the ALPL gene which excluded this possibility. Another possibility is still OI. All are healthy The mother is pregnant now in the first weeks. First US on 14 weeks was normal.</summary>

		<summary>Observation The patient is a girl, 7 years old, the first child of healthy and non-consanguineous parents. She had normal development, her stature was bellow 3rd percentile.She was born with a preaxial polydactyly in left hand. We have noticed important scoliosis during clinical exam and asked for X-rays that showed segmental defects of spine and marked costal anomalies. Abdominal ultrasonography and echocardiography were normal ( though, she had a small ASD with no clinical relevance). Radiographs of the spines of both parents were interpreted as normal The mother said that some of her relatives had spine problems(?) - we haven`t examined them. We have found these references in literature but Zeller's paper is hard to find... References: Day R, Fryer A. Diaphragmatic hernia and preaxial polydactyly in spondylothoracic dysplasia.

She was born at term with birth length 46 cm (3.-5. ct), birth weight of 2900 g (10. ct), cleft soft palate and stenosis of the nasolacrimal duct. Her psychomotor development was normal (she started to walk at the age of 14, speech at the age of 11 months, although she had a relative hypotonia, and undergo physical habilitation). She also had bilateral hip subluxation. At the age of 2 years and 4 months she was admitted to our Department, her hight was 76 cm (-4.07 SD), weight 12 kg (25%), BMI 20,8 kg/m2 (+3.23 SD), head circumference 46.5 cm (75% per height). Clinical findings revealed pectus infundibuliforme, mild facial dysmorphism €“ oval, flat face, mild midface hypoplasia, mild hypertelorism, anteverted nostrils, long philtrum, lower set ears, short neck. She also had mild umbilical hernia, pronounced lumbar lordosis, coxa and genua vara (more expressed on the right), pedes plani and waddling gait. Oftalmologic examination was normal. The roendgenograms revealed (prof. Hall): €žShe has pseudoepiphyses of the metacarpals, and strikingly of the distal ends of the proximal phalanges. There is some stippling or fragmentation of the hand epiphyses. In addition the vertebral bodies are oval and there is pectus excavatum. The femoral necks are short with coxa vara. (I doubt that there could have been subluxation of the hips - it was probably unusual prominance of the greater trochanters as a result of the coxa vara). There is genu varum and flared irregular metaphyses with small corner fractures. The epiphyses are small and fragmented. The family history is negative for skeletal dysplasia.</summary>

First postnatal weeks complicated by feeding problems and pulmonary problems. Clinical investigation was described to be rather unsuspicious, but there was micrognathia and bilateral club feet.No thoracic deformities are mentioned in the reports, but the parents report that the thorax was already deformed at birth. Ultrasound of brain, inner organs : normal. Karyotype 46 XX. Orthopedic controls : conservative management of severe bilateral clubfeet ( a neuromuscular disorder was suspected) and delayed hip maturation .Some months ago, orthopaedic surgery had to be interrupted because of pulmonary insufficiency. First admission to our department because of short stature and further diagnostic approach in October, 2003. Physical examination: Length 63,7 cm ( mean age control 82 cm)- birth length was 49 cm. Head circumference 48 cm ( 50th percentile for age) Short limbs, lordosis (see photographs)- Thorax deformity Ears: normal, no cysts ( from birth on) Hands: no “hitchhiker thumb”, but peculiar 1st toes (photo) Teeth: regular.

		<summary>Diagnosis suggested by Christine Hall based on Xray findings. Second child of unrelated parents who are of normal stature. Term delivery weighing 3.6kg (50-75th centile), length 42cm (&lt;0.4th centile), OFC 39cm (&gt;99.6th centile). She has a short trunk with a short, broad chest and distended abdomen and small umbilical hernia. She has short limbs, incomplete elbow extension, mild bowing of the lower legs, normal hands, but metatarsus varus. Her facial appearance and palate were normal. Her cranial ultrasound showed prominent ventricles but no hydrocephalus. At her initial skeletal survey SEDC was queried but her repeat X-rays age 6 months were not typical and were felt to be suggestive of mild Torrance type dysplasia. At 6 months, her length was 55cm (5cm &lt;0.4th centile), weight 5.99kg (0.4-2nd centile) and OFC 45.3cm (91-98th centile). She has some motor delay but normal social development, feeding and general health. None Her initial films age 1 week have been reported by Christine Hall as showing short long bones, delayed ossification of knee epiphyses, small thorax, mild platyspondyly. The changes are those of a skeletal dysplasia and are suggestive of SEDC. The subsequent films age 6 months were reported as showing rounded vertebral bodies with a kyphosis developing at L2. The long bones are short, mildly bowed with metaphyseal flaring and spurs. Horizontal acetabular roofs with short iliac bones. Not SEDC but possible Torrance (Type II collagenopathy).</summary>

		<summary>x-rays from Original referral: Pain in hips, feet, and hands with a mild thoracic kyphoscoliosis. The pain appears to be mainly from the hips. There are no abnormalities of the palate or the ears. He did not have club feet but has striking bilateral metatarsus adductus. Height: 175.4 cm, Weight: 59.6 kg. Email from David Rimoin: “We just saw Alex Dorn and his fiance , reviewed his records and old X-rays and took a few new ones. Over the years he has been given the diagnosis of Chondrodysplasia punctata, SED and MED. He is of normal height (although short for his family), has normal vision and a prominent nose, but his fingers are expanded at the interphalangeal joints and resemble those of Kniest dysplasia. His early X-rays show severe thoracic vertebral defects and fragmentation of the non epiphyseal ends of the metacarpals and phalanges similar to Kniest! The Manchester lab has found normal COMP and Matrillin 3 and is apparently now looking at COL9. Ralph Lachman and I think that he may well represent a Kniest mosaic, similar to a previous patient that we have seen who had a typical Kniest offspring. Thus we feel that COL2 should be examined, especially the amino end of the molecule! The couple wants to get pregnant soon if they can attempt prenatal diagnosis.” none This patient is traveling and seing doctors all over the world. Originally referred by Dr. Burck-Lehmann in Cologne, Germany. Then by Dr Komudi Siriwardena, Northern Regional Genetic Service, Bldg 18 Auckland Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, KomudiS@adhb.govt.nz. Then by David Rimoin. Dr Komudi Siriwardena from New Zealand also contacted Luisa Bonafe regarding rMED, DTDST testing in this case. DNA is available in Manchester.

Patient was asymptomatic for celiac disease. - on skeletal survey, there were slight changes suggesting SED (our radiologist's opinion). Question: Can it be an asymptomatic coeliac disease in a child with short stature without GI symptoms? [Stenhammar L et. al. Eur. j. pediatr 1986 August 145(3)]. Parents are not blood relatives. Proband is the only child and affected person in the family. She is product of mother's second pregnancy, that was un-eventful and the baby was delivered by C/S because of the breach presentation. Mother's first pregnancy ended by spontaneous abortion in the 3rd month Her mother and father are completely healthy.</summary>

He was referred to the hospital at 6 months of age because of cows milk protein intolerance and poor growth according to length.His height was then 61 cm ( -3 Standard deviations) and his weight 8175 g( 50th percentile) The visual impression was a chubby boy with short extremities, short and broad hands and fingers. Most joints are hypermobile except for the elbows that has a slight extension deficit. He is now 18 months and his heigt is about 69 cm (-5 SD or more), weight 9415 g( -2,5 SD) and HC 48 cm(50th percentile). His sitting height 47,5 cm which gives a sitting height percentage of 69%. He has an infection related asthma and is occasionaly treated with salbutamol and budesonide. He continues to react to cows milk, but seems otherwise to be healthy. His psychomotoric developement is so far normal, he is a social and curious guy who talks single words. He walks without support since a few weeks.He has no cleft palate, no hearing or vision problems and no dysmorphic facial features as far as I can see. Mother 155 cm, father 171 cm. No heredity for extremely short stature, although the father has a nephew who is 160 cm and the shortest of the relatives. Please see also the X-rays that were sent earlier.

Miny and other authors in a dysmorphology meeting in Istanbul-Turkey on 15-16,April 2005 3-year-old female patient, She was referred to our hospital during three years of age for the presence of congenital sensorineural hearing loss and abnormal-shaped nose. Her weight, length and head circumference were 12.3 kg (10-25 p), 91 cm (10-25 p) and 47 cm (50 p), respectively. On physical examination, frontal bossing, ocular hypertelorism, long philtrum, saddle nose deformity, depressed nasal root and bridge, prominent alae nasi, telecanthus and micrognathia were noted. She also had broad wrist and ankle, broad great toes, and fetal pads on fingers and. She had a normal mental-motor development. Brain computerized tomography was normal. Hearing test (BERA) revealed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The laboratory investigation including complete blood count, routine biochemical testing of liver and kidney function and measurement of serum levels of electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and urine mucopolysaccharide analysis were all in normal limits. Echocardiogram was normal. Chromosome analysis showed a normal karyotype. The mother, a healthy 34-year-old woman was married to her maternal first cousin, a healthy 38-year-old man. Antenatal USG revealed polyhydramnios and bone dysplasia. The mother had seven pregnancies.The first two children had died due to prematurity and pneumoniae, respectively and it was learned that the first one had a similar nose shape with the patient, while the second had a cleft palate. The patient’s family history was otherwise unremarkable.</summary>

		<summary>xrays Case: A 29 year old patient came after termination of the 4th pregnancy.The first pregnancy resulted in normal child (girl). The second and the third pregnancy ended as missed abortions in the 10th weeks of pregnancy. In the 15th weeks of the fourth pregnancy the cystic hygroma was discovered and the patient decided for the terminantion. The fetus had kleeblattschaedel, narrow thorax and marked shortening of long bones. The radiographs are attached. I can't decide if the femurs are bowed enough for TD type I or straight enough for type II. none referring physician wants FGFR3 analysis</summary>

Macrocephaly and short limbs noted at 8 weeks of age. Two cranial ultrasound scans have shown non-progressive mild dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles. Her weight is increasing between the 9th and 25th centiles, but her length has fallen from the 9th centile at 4 weeks of age to less than 0.4th centile at the age of 16 weeks. She began sitting without support at the age of 9 months and could pull herself to standing and cruise around furniture at the age of 14 months. She was making babbling sounds and had one single word at the age of 14 months. No history of hypotonia. No problems with hearing or eyesight. No history of bowel or urinary problems. No history of sleep apnoea. Her immunizations are up-to-date. O/E: weight on 9th centile, length 66.4cm (3cm below 0.4th centile), arm span 61.5cm, upper segment to lower segment ratio 1.55, and head circumference 48.5cm (75th €“ 91st centile). Macrocephaly with open anterior fontanelle and frontal prominence, mid-face hypoplasia and a small nose. Small hands with trident anomaly of the middle three fingers of both hands. Rhizomelic shortening of upper and lower limbs with excessive skin folds over her arms, forearms, thighs and legs. Full extension at both elbows. No thoracolumbar kyphosis. No cardiac murmurs. Mild laxity at both knees. Absent deep tendon reflexes in her upper and lower limbs. No ankle clonus. Both plantars down-going. First child of healthy unrelated parents. Father 5ft 11.5in tall and mother€™s height 5ft 9in. No family history of short stature. Clinical findings are suggestive of achondroplasia but x-ray changes are not those of achondroplasia but are suggestive of an FGFR3 gene disorder possibly severe end of the spectrum of hypochondroplasia.</summary>

		<summary>clinically and radiographically This is a family with affected mother and son. The mother, now 50 years has short stature (height 144 cm), span 152cm and head circumference 54.8cm. Intelligence is normal. During childhood, she underwent corrective surgery for varus of the lower limbs. X-rays at age 2yrs 8 months show varus of the hips and broadened metaphyses. X-rays at adult age show varus position of the hips and mild bowing of the femur. The son, now age 29, was born with normal height, but evaluated at age 20 months because of short stature (height 78.7 cm (p7), weight 11.350g (p15). He had marked varus of the lower limbs. Calcium metabolism was normal. X-rays showed metaphyseal changes leading to the diagnosis at that time of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid. (not specified). At age 7, X-ray of the hips showed broadening of the metaphysic of the femur and coax vara. No X-rays are available. Later, he underwent corrective surgery for genu vara and lengthening of the legs by Ilizarov technique. Now, at age 29, height is 164 cm (after bone lengthening), span 172.5 cm. He has Varus of the knees and bowing of the tibia. X-rays showed in addition a varus position of the hips. see above - mother same disorder case is submitted for confirmation of diagnosis before DNA analysis, as requested by the Ingelheim group</summary>

The father was 35 years and the mother 26 years of age when he was born. His older brother is healthy and of normal stature. Pregnancy: There were no complications of pregnancy and fetal movement was reportedly normal. Delivery, at term, was by lower segment cesarean section for failure of progression of labour. The neonatal period was unremarkable and he was discharged home from hospital with his mother. At 31 days of life he had a seizure. An EEG was done at the time and showed active epileptic discharges over the left fronto-temporal region consistent with partial seizures or partial seizures with secondary generalization. He was treated with an anti-epileptic drug for 2 years with no recurrence of seizure activity during that time or since. (The parents cannot recall the name of the drug that was used) Follow-up EEG or brain MRI was not done. Milestones: Murtada had normal motor and cognitive development. He walked at about 1 year of age. His parents took him to Lebanon to a clinic in May 2004 where he was prescribed Genosave which was supposed to increase his height. He took this medication from May 2004 to April 2005 and showed no increase in height but did become hyperactive during that time. Physical examination: Murtada was very active, talkative, pleasant and cooperative. He was noticeably short for his age and had mildly dysmorphic features. The main features were brachycephaly, closed sutures, very plentiful hair of normal texture, a square-shaped forehead with a low anterior hairline, a wide inner canthal distance, downslanting palpebral fissures, long eyelashes, a short broad nose, flat midface, short(10th%),relatively flat philtrum,large ears (95th%)with normal location and development, a round face, barrel-shaped chest with wide inter-nipple distance, normal male genitalia with both testes in the scrotum, brachydactyly (palm length: 25th%; middle finger length 3rd%), normal palmar and digital creases, short distal phalanges and nails, hyperextensible finger joints and normal feet measuring at the 10th%. NOTE: Many of Murtada's facial features are similar to those of his father who is of normal stature. Please see pdf attachment Ethnicity: the patient is a Saudi Arab. I'm not sure what category to use in the box above. Note: the parents would not consent to photographs of the patient without his clothes.</summary>

From our notes, it appears that she only came to medical attention when referred because of serum-sickness type illness related to desensitisation injections for housedust mite at age 11. The consultant who saw her then referred her because he notes short, bowed limsb and mild dysmorphic features. Skeletal survey reported as MED. I first met Amanda in July 2001. She had increasing pain and limited mobility of her left hip. She had short, mildly bowed limbs and postural scoliosis. The proximal limb bones appear shorter than the distal bones. There is Madelung deformity of the wrists. She has a prominent forehead. Her fingers and toes are stubby. Hands and feet are broad. There is no evidence of problems with vision or hearing. She did not have cleft palate. Her skeletal survey was repeated at that time and again reported as mild MED. She has since had L hip replacement which ahs greatly improved her postural scoliosis. Family History: No H/O skeletal dysplasia Eldest in sibship of 7 – includes one IUD at 20weeks, one stillbirth at term and one sister with neural tube defect. Parents non-consanguineous Caucasians.

		<summary>- She is 24 years old woman from first normal pregnancy and delivery of healthy and unrelated parents. Birth wait were 3250g and birth length 49cm, respectively. She had a normal physical development until 1 year of age when parents sow that the child has unstable gait. Later on there was a progressive deformation of the spine with a relative shortening of the trunk, deformation of interphalangeal joints, bulging of the knees and maleoles, join pain. I sow her at first when she was 14 years of age. She had a normal height (SDS=-1.35), short and wide thorax, kyphoscoliosis, deformation of interphalangeal joints with joint laxity, limitation of movements of elbows, bulging and deformation of the knees, neck and hip pain, normal vision, no hearing problems, and normal pubertal development. There was normal metabolic screening (MPS was also excluded). X-ray survey revealed thoraco-lumbar scoliosis, dysplastic lateral part of clavicles, platyspondyly, dysplasitic vertebral bodies with prominent hypoplasia of the anterior part, metaepiphyseal irregularities of the surfacing bone ends of the ankles and knees, dysplastic carpal bones, dysplastic epiphyses of radius and ulna, dysplastic epiphyses of femoral heads and shorter and broad femoral necks, generalized osteoporosis. A diagnosis of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia was established and she was referred to department of orthopedics for long term follow-up. I sow her again 10 years later, the last February. Her final height is 149 cm, hand span is 149 cm and lower segment length is 60 cm. She has the same body proportions with shortness of the trunk, joint deformations best seen in fingers and knees, joint laxity of interphalangeal joints, decreased mobility of some of the affected joints and normal vision. Because of precocious osteoarthrosis, a few years ago she underwent a left hip arthroplasty with replacement of a prothesis (X-rays of the hips are before the prothesis replacement) and she is not able to walk without support (walking sticks). In addition she has shortness of 4th metatarsal bone of left foot (clinically observed, no X-rays). When I have discussed this patient with Prof. Fryns and the other my colleagues here in Leuven, two diagnoses have been supposed, an Autosomal Dominant Spondylarthropathy due to mutation in COL2A1 gene (she has finger join laxity, shortness of 4th metatarsal) or a Progresive Pseudorheumatoid Chondrodysplasia. However because of more rapid progression of the disease with development of hip dysplasia (arthrotic changes of femoral heads) required arthroplasty in second decade we think that she presents a Pseudorheumatoid Chondrodysplasia. -</summary>

The foetus presented also an elevated nuchal translucency in the first trimester; the amniocentesis retrieved a normal karyotype. Ascites was first noted at about 18 weeks of gestation. The Rx examination (23 weeks of gestation) demonstrated bilateral presence of femoral nucleous ossification centers as well as some tarsal nucleous ossification centers, which were radiographically, very dense. Some vertebral abnormalities were also noted. Fetal-anatomopathologist examination: storage disease. In the placenta the storage is present in Hofbauer cells and in trophoblastic cells, storage in the liver, mainly in Kupffer cells. The storage is also present in the kidney, demonstrated by colloidal iron in the podocytes. The storage is also visible in the spleen. a storage disease involving sialic acid metabolism is likely: - free sialic acid storage disease - galactosialidosis -sialidosis none the first diagnosis was a storage disease involving sialic acid metabolism, but we did not find in the literature of these disorders, the bone abnormalities present in the foetus</summary>

The vertebral bodies show some anterior wedging in the thoracic region and there is mild irregularity of the vertebral end plates. Bilateral spondylolysthesis of L5. In the pelvis the acetabular roofs are horizonal and slightly irregular. The capital femoral epiphyses are wide and somewhat flattened with articular irregularity. The femoral necks are short and broad. The lower femoral metaphysis is flared and irregular and the lower femoral epiphysis is unusually large. In the hand, the epiphyses are all rounded and relatively large. the appearances are those of an undescribed metaphyseal or spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Normal pregnancy. Normal term delivery weighing 2.59kg. Short arms noted at 4 days. Xrays showed a severe, predominantly metaphyseal dysplasia. Very good subsequent progress with virtual resolution of radiological changes. On review at 13.3 years: Has recurrent upper respiratory infections Moderate sensorineural hearing loss Double curve scoliosis currently managed with bracing Mild learning disability Normal vision and eye examination. On examination: Height 142.3cm (2-9th centile), span/height 1.0, US/LS 1.14, OFC 55.8cm (75-90th centile), weight 56.9kg (75-91st centile). Stocky build. Closed fontanelle. Mildly flattened face, slightly short nose and low nasal bridge, normal palate and uvula. Normal forearm movements. Right single palmar crease. Fairly large knee and ankle joints. Mildly flat feet. Scoliosis. No hepatosplenomegaly. Parents and 3 siblings are of normal stature. No consanguinity. Although Jansen metaphyseal dysplasia was considered on the early films, the hand changes were felt to be too mild and he has not had any of the associated calcium problems. The radiological appearances have resolved to a remarkable extent. We considered Stickler / OSMED from a clinical point of view but his Xrays are not in keeping.</summary>

		<summary>X-ray skeletal investigations and clinical evaluation Patient (III1) A 9-year-old boy with good results at school and high IQ. He was born from a normal uneventful pregnancy from young healthy parents. He started to walk at the age of 7 months. When he was 5 years old, he was noted to have difficulty walking and climbing the stairs. He started to walk on his tip toes, never ran well and was complaining about knee and muscle pain. At present he is not able to run, he has waddling gait and stiffness with problems in maintaing balance. He is tired after walking even a short distances. Improvement after physical exercises during rehabilitation is observed. The abnormalities in the neurological examination performed in October 2009: distally slightly reduced muscle strength in the upper and lower limbs, absent ankle jerks. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia - myopathy were suspected but laboratory results were negative. Spinal MRI was normal with minimal protrusion of intravertebral discs in the Th10-11 and L5-S1. Anthropometric results are in the normal range and body proportion is normal. Weight 36 kg; height 132cm. Laboratory investigations: 1. Muscle biopsy m. quadriceps sinister - There are no abnormalities 2. A positive result of electrostimulation test. 3. AChR antibodies-the results in a normal range -0.11 nmol/l ( negative results below 0.25 nmol/l) 4. Biochemical tests (glucose, AST, ALT, ALP, Ca, P, ureic acid, CK, lactic acid, SAICAR, biotynidase, karnityne , aminogram, CDG, MPS in urine, GC-MS)-the results in a normal range 5. Serologic investigation for JRA diagnosis are negative 6. Karyotype: normal male 46,XY see pedigree Patient (III3) This 21 year old female patient was a product of incested pregnancy (father and his daughter). Her father is also the grandfather of patient (III1). She was born 25.10.1988 and we have very little information about her clinical symptoms in early infancy. We know that she was born with short stature, body disproportion because of lower and upper limbs shortening. At present time her body height is 137 cm. Intellectual development was evaluated in the normal range. Because of joints pain juvenile rheumatologic arthritis was diagnosed at the age of 10 years, but because of incomplete medical documentation we have no results of serologic investigations that could confirm this diagnosis. We know that at the age of 10 years suspicion of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia was considered on the basis of X-ray skeletal changes. At present time she has a bilateral hip endoprothesis and Achilles tendon surgery because of joint deformations and stiffness. Several X-rays before surgery (very poor quality) and photographs are enclosed. We considered that JRA and epiphyseal dysplasia in this female are a coincidental event.</summary>

The prenatal and neonatal periods uneventfully. When she was 2 years old, her mother noticed some deformity and limited extension of the fingers of both hands. Her right leg also with some irregularities during deambulation. We don€™t have more information on her clinical manifestations until she was 7 years old, the first clinical/genetic evaluation was done when she was 7 years 6 months old. She has been studied in different hospitals and with different doctors so the information is incomplete. At 7 years 6 months old: Height 113 cms (p3), weight 24,700 grs (p50), cephalic perimeter 54.5 cms (&gt;p97), SI 55 cms, SS 58 cms, Rel SS/SI 1.05. Without characteristic facies, lumbar hiperlordosis, without clinical data or shortening of any body segment. What called the attention of the geneticist that was exploring her was the short fingers in both hands, interphalangeal widening and limited extension of the finger bilaterally. At that time the clinical diagnosis was hipochondroplasia. The urine levels of phosphate and calcium were high: 535 mg/2h hrs and 32 mg/24 hrs respectively. (We don€™t have the Rx of that age.) At 23 years of age se had chondrolysis in both hips, treated with sinovectomy in 1984 with out a favourable evolution so she got a Furlong right femoral head prosthetic replacement in 1995, few months latter she got an arthroplasty in left femoral head because of the chondrolysis.

Short and cone-shaped mecarphal and phalanges. Doppler color echocardiogram showed mild aortic stenosis and bivalve aorta. Metabolic screening, Ca, P, alkaline phosphatase and thyroid tests were normal or negative. The propositus was a product of a first gestation of a 31-years-old mother and 30-years-old father, both healthy and non-consanguineous. No teratogenous exposure was recorded and family history was negative for bone dysplasias. Radiographic examination of both parents were normal (mother height was159 cm, father height was 180 cm).

His appearance is of short limbs with a relatively long trunk, and no scoliosis. He has short hyperflexible fingers with wide nails, and his elbows have restricted extension. His lower limbs also seem hypermobile and his legs show marked genu varum, leading to a slightly waddling gait. He has no frontal bossing or other dysmorphic features. Parents/older sibs have normal stature. No similarly affected relatives.

Maroteaux Pierre in Paris and by prof.Kopits in Baltimora (USA). Benedetta is cm 1.42 tall,weights kg 50 and the head circumference is cm 53. She has shorts limbs, not too much;she has limitation in the extension of the elbows, short fingers, joint laxity. She has lumbar lordosis. She has been operated in 1984 (at 8 years)for genu varum (bilateral osteothomy of tibia and fibula) and in 1992 and 1993 (at 16 and 17 years) at right and left hip respective (Chiari arthroplasty)because she had pain at the hips. Now, she is doing well, she gets tired after 600-700 meters of walking and she has to sit.If she walks too much she has pain at hips and knees. She has 3 sisters: none of them affected.

Ultrasound examination at 30th gestational weeks revealed shortening of long bones. Delivery of baby was breech,his birth weight and lenght were 2880 g and 40.2 cm respectively, head circomference (OFC) was 36 cm, APGAR scores were 9 and 9 at1 and 5 minutes respectevely. He was immediately noted to have short limbs and posterior cleft palate. Cerebral, renal echography, cardiac evaluation were normal. He showed mild generalized hypotonia. His physical examination at 9 months showed weight 6200 g (3rd centile), lenght 59 (&lt;-2DS), head circumpherence (OFC) 45 cm (&gt;25th centile) total hand lenght 7 cm (3rd centile) middle finger lenght 3 cm ( 3-10th centile). Fine and sparse hair, macrocephaly, wide and prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge,short nose with anteverted nares, short neck. Shortness of upper and lower limbs, particularly  rizomelic segment. Family history was unremarkable Would is it useful to repeat another X ray for the diagnosis?

No This patient was seen in London, Manchester and at the Little People of America. Jacky Taylor also contacted Dr Kay Metcalfe who said the patient's file in Manchester mentioned that the case was also sent to Dr Ilkka Kaitila, Helsinki, Finland (ilkka.kaitila@hus.fi) in the past, but the outcome was not recorded. Old x-rays are unavailable. As apparently there is no doubt on the diagnosis, Dr Fryer did not want to x-ray the patient again. ASF accepted to screen the case without x-rays.

		<summary>Ortopaedic consultation Barbara was born with a diagnosis of a generalized skeletal dysplasia with dysplastic hypertrophia of the epiphysis associated with ocular protrusion, low set ears and anomalies of the 4th finger. Her birth weight was gm 4000. She was hospitalized because of ingestion of amniotic liquid. When she was one year old, spinal deformities were evidenced. At 3 years of age orthopaedic shoes were prescribed. High myopia was also diagnosed in infancy. 1983. Orthopaedic consultation with diagnosis of epyphisal-metaphysal displasia with dorsal cyfosis of high degree. Flexed hip that could not be corrected, flexed valgism of the knees were also noted (intervention with corrective osteotomy of the right and left tibia were performed) and osteocondrosis of the vertebral bodies. 1985 Surgey: tibial osteotomy with perone osteotomy and bilateral proximal tibial epiphisiodesis. 1992 Surgery of the right proximal tibia. (knee varism) 1993. Another surgery for valgism of the knees. A progression of the right-convex dorsal scoliosis was also noted with a reduction of the vertebral bodies in a clinical picture compatible with Scheuermann disease. 1997 Surgery of the left knee. 1998 Surgery because of valgus right foot. 1999 Surgery of valgism of left knee. Cardiovascular aspects: systolic murmur, normal ecocardiogramme with hypercinesia without valvular dysfunctions and normal biventricular kinetics. ENT: mild bilateral trasmissive hypoacusia of the high frequencies. Abdominal and inguinal echographies: normal. Bilateral mammary ecography: fibrocystic displasia. Melanoma of the left gastrocnemious (asportation of 2 nei). 2006. Genetic counselling at our Hospital with Ortopaedic consultation: suspected diagnosis: Epyphisal-metapiphysal dysplasia with vertebral involvement. Her actual height is cm 152.

		<summary>By an ophthalmologist and a clinical geneticist Eye: The patient has had severe myopia (-12) since childhood, left retinal detachment at the age of 24, cataract in both eyes. The right retina has been treated with laser. At the moment the left eye is blind but the vision in the right eye is quite good (0.6). Other: The patient has mild hypermobility of the joints, mild midfacial hypoplasia and pectus carinatum. In addition, she has had several low-energy bone fractures (typically occur in normal situations such as hugging, falling down). The patient recalls that she has had the following low-energy fractures: 2 ribs (at the age of 46 years), left wrist and one of the right metacarpal bones (at the age of 52 years), V right metatarsal bone (at 38 years) and left ankle (at 33 yers of age). She has had no major hearing problems (minor problem in hearing high sounds which was thought to be age-related). Her father was blind and had severe hearing problems, and her paternal grandfather's other eye was blind since childhood. The patient has a daughter with similar eye problems and a healthy son. The brother of the patient has similar eye problems and one of his daughters (12 years) has severe eye problems and she has had several low-energy bone fractures. The patient would be very inetrested in genetic testing. In literature search we found only one family with Stickler features + a tendency for bone fractures but no gene defect has been published in this family. In order to plan for gene testing, we would greatly appreciate to hear your opinion on the diagnosis and the possible relevant gene test.</summary>

		<summary>Saoirse was born at 39 weeks of gestation following a pregnancy complicated by mild hypertension at the end of the 3rd trimester. Delivery was by elective lower segment caesarian section. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Birth weight was 2.72kg and Saoirse was admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit for 5 days. Short proximal limbs, flat nasal bridge and macrocephaly were noted at birth. Cranial ultrasound in the neonatal period was normal. At 8 months of age Saoirse was very alert. She was trying to roll over but not yet sitting alone. She was babbling and could say dada. She had a good appetite and was thriving. At 3 months of age she was hospitalised for gastroenteritis and bronchitis but was otherwise healthy. Dysmorphic examination: Saoirse's head circumference was &gt;95th centile and she had a wide anterior fontanelle, a high prominent forehead, narrow bitemporal diameter, a midline haemangioma on the forehead extending to the right eyebrow and and eyelid, a low nasal bridge, bifid nasal tip with thin midline haemangioma, small low-set ears with an overfolded helix, prominent earlobes, normal palate and uvula, two lower incisors, an occipital haemangioma, small spatulate hands with short distal phalanges , small deep-set fingernails, deep palmar and digital creases, short proximal limbs with redundant skin, short distal phalanges of the toes and small deep-set toenails. When sitting, Saoirse had apparent distal thoracic/proximal lumbar kyphosis and distal lumbar lordosis. She also had deep circular creases on the upper arms, a deep horizontal crease over the knee joints and a circular crease at the ankle joints. Saoirse is the only child of a 33-year-old mother and a 44-year-old father. They are a non-consanguineous, healthy couple. Saoirse's mother has a short stature syndrome that has never been diagnosed. She had a cleft lip and palate at birth and currently suffers from frequent headaches and back pain but is otherwise healthy and has normal intelligence. There is no other history of short stature in either maternal or paternal families.</summary>

Histology: longitudinal sections show a bent and shortened femora with the diaphysis showing poorly developed cortex. the epiphyseal growth zone shows mildly irregular and variable elongated columnar zones at the transition into the bone. also variable sized islands of hyaline cartilage in bone trabeculae and cortex. this change is seen in hypophosphatasia. antenatal scan showed rhizomelia, micromelia, and mild hydronephrosis 2 previous normal pregnancied with a former partener. Courtney's first pregnancy for this couple which was terminated. no DNA was taken from Courtney although chromosome analysis was normal. after COurtney the couple had an intrauterine death at 15 weeks but no obvious skeletal abnormalities were identified. the couple are again expecting and a 20 week scan has identified some features suggestive of undermineralisation (in skull parietal region).posterior elements of spine but vertebral bodies fine. does not look the same as as courtney who was diagnosed on 23 week scan. i would be grateful if this case could be assessed urgently in light of the findings in the current pregnancy i have emailed Dr Mornet (Universite de Versailles) regarding the family already and parental DNA is available. please liase with Dr Bronwyn Kerr during the period 14.3.05-20.3.05. her email is bronwyn.kerr@cmmc.nhs.uk</summary>

		<summary>Initially suggested by Professor Christine Hall after James'maternal uncle Martin Southall's skeletal survey was reviewed in 1987. James, his brother Thomas Lowe (dob 19/03/199) and their maternal uncles Mark Southall (dob 20/12/1966) and Martin Southall (dob 12/12/1969) all have similar features Both James and Thomas have similar facial features - prominent eyes, down slanting palpebral fissures, prominent glabella; relative macrocephaly - OFC 50th-75th centiles with height and weight 0.4th -2nd centiles; both are hirsute particularly over back and legs. Both have generalised joint hypermobility. James - very lax finger and toe joints except joint contractures of distal IP joints both middle fingers; lateral deviation of 2nd toes and overriding of 3rd toes. Thomas - 12 month history of deformity of right middle finger and pain and swelling over left wrist and hand; now has contractures of distal and proximal IP joints of right middle finger; tenderness and swelling over dorsum left wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints. Both boys have normal IQ. James - dilated aortic root; Thomas - normal heart. James - MRI brain scan at 5 years - mild dilatation of lateral and 3rd ventricles. James and Thomas are the only 2 children of Angela who has similar facial features, is of normal height and has normal heart. Angela had 2 brothers - Mark and Martin Southall. Mark died suddenly at age 19in 1986. PM - ruptured dissecting aortic aneurysm with dilated aortic root; was 172.5 cm tall, had lax joints, long tapering fingers and flat feet; had prominent eyes and frontal bossing. His brother Martin had a skeletal survey after Mark's death and this was when a diagnosis of Melnick-Needles was suggested. Martin also had dilated aortic root, was facially like Mark and had short stature (150cm). Martin died unexpectedly at age 17 in 1987. PM - subluxation of cervical spine due to malformation at base of skull. Mark, Martin and Angela's parents have no dysmorphic features and have normal hearts. No other significant family history</summary>

As adult, has ulnar deviation of fingers, flat facies, flat feet, limited elbow extension. Height 136cm with head circumf 59.5cm. Brother seen at 2 years, when he had a scoliosis, prominent forehead and depressed nasal bridge, lax joints except elbows which had restricted extension. Head 50cm, height 72.7cm. Xrays said to show multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with only minor platyspondyly, but subsequently said to show epiphyseal changes and scoliosis, likely pseudochondroplasia. Problems through childhood, needed surgery to knees and considered for spinal surgery but decided against this. Heather diagnosed about 4 years of age, also genu valgum and had knee surgery. 4'4 tall in adult life. Decreased elbow extension and supination. Lumbar lordosis. Flat face. Glasses for myopia in adult life. Genu valgum in childhood. (Has had osteotomies so difficult to assess now.) Decreased elbow extension and decreased supination. Short fingers, distal contractures. Lumbar lordosis. Flat face. No scoliosis clinically, but brother has severe scoliosis. Affected father and paternal half brother. Brother more severely affected, and is the only one to have a significant scoliosis. Patient very keen to get a molecular diagnosis to allow prenatal testing. COMP mutation analysis has already been done in a US commercial lab and no mutation identified.</summary>

		<summary>radiologically - round vertebral bodies, distinctive hands with small epiphyses of metacarpals and carpal delay, generalised dysplastic metaphyseal changes. Capital femoral epiphyses are small. Films reviewed by Ravi Savarirayan 3yo female Normal birth weight and pregnancy history FTT - weighs 8kg at 3yo, wt and ht &lt;&lt;3rd centile, OFC on 50th Motor delay - delayed walking but otherwise normal intellect, hypotonic, ?muscle weakness Hypermobility - very lax joints particularly at ankles Metaphyseal dysplasia - see report below Short stature - appears proportionate Tooth decay Numerous small CALs Flattish midface - see pics in seperate file Swollen middle phalange of 3rd fingers bilaterally - soft tissue only ? cause SKELETAL SURVEY: REPORT: LONG BONES: The proximal femoral, distal femoral, proximal tibial and distal tibial metaphyses are abnormal. There is irregularity at the zone of provisional calcification most marked in the distal femora with a degree of flaring. There are longitudinal dense striations suggesting an appearance of osteopathia striata most marked in the metaphyses at the knees. The femoral necks bilaterally appear rather gracile with metaphyseal irregularity and coxa valga. The pelvis appears normal and no abnormality of the epiphyses is seen except for retarded development consistent with presumed developmental delay. AP CHEST: The lungs appear clear. The nasogastric tube tip is noted in the body of the stomach. There are a few tiny spots of increased density over the liver probably artifact but calcification cannot be excluded and sonography is suggested. The cardiac size is normal. Abnormal proximal humeral metaphyses noted. There does not appear to be any disproportionate shortening of the long bones and the clavicles are normally developed. LATERAL SPINE: The vertebral bodies show normal height and there is no evidence of platyspondyly. The odontoid process appears however to be smaller than normal. This would need to be confirmed by coned views of this region which are unavailable. AP HANDS: There is soft tissue swelling bilaterally in the vicinity of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger. There is retarded development of the epiphyses consistent with growth retardation. AP FEET: There appears to be a degree of hindfoot valgus deformity but no other abnormality of the feet is seen. LATERAL SKULL: There is no abnormal intracranial calcification and the sella turcica appears normal. The cranial sutures are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Overall, there is evidence of abnormal metaphyseal development as described most marked in the distal femora but also present in the proximal femora, proximal tibiae, distal tibiae and proximal humeri. The appearances suggest the possibility of a form of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Longitudinal striations at the knee also suggest a component of osteopathia striata. I cannot easily correlate the swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints in the middle fingers with the skeletal survey findings. Pseudorheumatoid chondrodysplasia would obviously be unlikely in view of the normal spine. Other differential diagnoses to be included for the metaphyseal changes include the milder form of hypophosphatasia and congenital infections including the TORCH group. Report dictated by Dr. L.L. Morris on 2.7.2007. She has been extensively investigated for the failure to thrive - including upper and lower endoscopy, and is currently being nasogastrically fed. Chromosomes/ subtel N, metabolic screen incl WCE N, coeliac N, brain MRI showed a small chiari malformation and very mild (questionable) demyelination. CK N, hearing and vision N. Muscle biopsy - normal, slight predominance of type 1 fibres. Immunoglobulins N. Growth hormone studies N, TFT N none. 2nd child of healthy NC parents. Parents heights average.</summary>

Birth weight 2820 g (at 37 + 5 weeks). Next visit at three years of age: severe scoliosis, multiple joint contractures (mainly at the knees and fingers), short neck, short stature (-5 SD, but with scoliosis and knee contractures), simian crease with short fingers. Face a bit square with mild flattening of the nasal bridge, short nose, and little facial expression. Normal development. Progressive scoliosis. Only child of nonconsanguineous dutch parents. Her mother has ocular myasthenia gravis. No mutation found in the FLNB gene (Dr. Robertson, New Zealand). Do you consider the contractures to be part of the skeletal disorder, or could this girl have two disorders (eg, spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome complicated with contractures due to maternal myasthenia gravis)? Parents are afraid of the recurrence risk, which can be very high (up to 100%) in case of maternal AChR antibodies.</summary>

Active at school and is able to engage in physical activities (several types of dancing) with relative ease i.e. there seems to be no significant functional restriction consequent upon her chest shape. Normal puberty. At the age of 14 years her weight was 33.7kg (0.4th percentile) and height 158.4cm (50th percentile). No problem with skin, teeth, hair or nails. No history of seizures. She has been experiencing what sound like fairly typical migraines for the last 2 years. During this period she saw an optician and no problems were identified on examination. OFC of 56 cm (~75th).
